            <p>Hello, COS (short for "Comic of Satire") is a comic series following a consciousness living inside of no host.
                This consciousness lives in a area refered to in the series as the "subspace" - subspace is an area in which nothing physical can exsist nor manifest.
            </p>

                The interesting part about this particular comic strip is that its (mostly) not made by me! - at least thats the idea.
