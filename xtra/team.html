            <p>COS is brought to you by two very amazing people :</p>
            <p>Roky Henderson - He was originally really inspired by <a href="https://xkcd.com/">xkcd</a> but wanted to have a fun twist on things. So he decided that a comic strip that i editable by multipul people was a good idea. What a nut-zo am I right?</p>
            <p>Max Hendra - He has helped a-lot with genral idea of COS. He was actually the OG inspiration for this comic.</p>
            <p>Thanks for being here. It means alot to at leat me and see you next time!</p>
            <p>Thanks, Roky.</p>
